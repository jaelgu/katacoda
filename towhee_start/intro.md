# Get Started with Towhee

Towhee is a flexible machine learning framework currently focused on computing deep learning embeddings over unstructured data. Built on top of PyTorch and Tensorflow (coming soon™), Towhee provides a unified framework for running machine learning pipelines locally, on a multi-GPU/TPU/FPGA machine (coming soon™), or in the cloud (coming soon™). Towhee aims to make democratize machine learning, allowing everyone - from beginner developers to AI/ML research groups to large organizations - to train and deploy machine learning models.
