# Question Answering System
Question answering is a classic problem in the field of natural language processing. While it sounds like an easy problem to solve, there is still a lot of research going on to improve the techniques that we have now. A large part of solving questions is finding questions that are similar to the one being asked. This is where Milvus comes into play, as Milvus can handle searching through billions of previously seen questions in a matter of milliseconds. Some use cases that can be seen today include: intelligent voice interaction, online customer service, knowledge acquisition, emotion-based chat, etc.

In this demo, we will build a question answering system based on Milvus & Mysql to deal with domain specific questions, in this case insurance.
